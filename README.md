# OntoGenesis Experiments with DBLP and ScholarlyData
This public repository contains the source codes as well as the results obtained in the experiments performed with the OntoGenesis, an architecture for semantically enriching data services.
Such experiments encompass a data service that provides metadata about articles from DBLP[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote1). As external sources of OntoGenesis, it employs datasets from ScholarlyData[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote2), which contains metadata about articles presented in some events of the Semantic Web area.
